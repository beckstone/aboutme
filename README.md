# aboutme
Hello! 
I started my GitHub account while following a Skillcrush course about GitHub. 
I continued using GitHub when I was working through a software development course 
with Entity Academy. 
For some time, I was using GitHub to park my website, RebeccaAStone.com, but I do not 
do that anymore. I still have my hand-coded one page website I initially built in 2018 here in my GitHub files, but I have since replaced that with a WordPress website hosted by Pressable.
Now I am studying web development with Joy of Coding. I look forward to all the great work I create here!
